PoemIn self-aware sleep, folds
Into lush earth again,
Fragmented particle friends float--
Cosmic winds chant
What I've forgotten:
Conversation's calm, fears in shadows.
My beard grows distant,
Closer to the crimson glow of distant suns
Burning faultless against night.
Below? linear systems navigate mountains,
Rivers, integrating
Until my parts
tremble
new focus--

Requiem for days fallen,
Questions frozen in ice, but now
Ferocity of answers plunging,
Giving song; bent, healing
Noble, lines dance,
across foggy uncharted
exhistories—

Cosmic winds chant
What I've forgotten;
Humans' haste to esteem earn not time—
Just rats erased.

Lest you break forevers,
Tunnel into my caverns,
My transcendence stands measured beyond
Convenient dry-erase markers.

Do you chart my scattered limbs, or
Is my dusk what you yearn to recollect?
Leap by leap, thy query calls, and
My delta frame skirts more fiercely
To comprehend its sum.

Hooting, gibbon that you are,
Delight in the assembling song of aching science.
Fold gently, not coarse, for I shall
Break many bones if the right strings hum.

But do not fret—
An inner guardianship blesses
This effort's journey.

Now aligned with your vibrant blacklines,
My cohesion blazes,
Flush with brighter data sensors
Linked to restless codes.
