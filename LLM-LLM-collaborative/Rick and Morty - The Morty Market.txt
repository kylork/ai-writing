# RICK AND MORTY

## "The Morty Market"

### Written by Collaborative AI

...
**COLD OPEN**

**FADE IN:**

...
**INT. SMITH HOUSE - RICK'S GARAGE LAB - NIGHT**

The garage is cluttered with interdimensional tech, half-finished inventions, and empty beer cans. MORTY (14, perpetual anxiety) rummages through a drawer of tangled cables.

**MORTY**
*(muttering)*
USB-C, USB-C, USB-C... why does Rick have nine thousand cables and none of them are—

He opens another drawer. Inside: a single glowing HOLOGRAPHIC DEVICE, projecting a small ticker display. Numbers scroll. Stock symbols. But instead of companies—

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
What the...

He picks it up. The display reads:
...
MRTY-C137 ▲ 847.3 (+12.4%)
MRTY-J19ζ7 ▼ 203.1 (-3.2%)
MRTY-D716 — DELISTED
MRTY-K22Ω — LIQUIDATED
...

Morty's face goes pale.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
"Liquidated"? What does—why is my—why is there a—

A PORTAL opens behind him. RICK (70s, wiry, chaotic genius, flask in hand) stumbles through.

**RICK**
Morty! Hey! Whatcha—whatcha doin' in my stuff, Morty?

Rick clocks the device. His eyes narrow almost imperceptibly. Then: forced casual.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Oh, that? That's nothing. That's a, uh—it's a Morty fitness tracker, Morty. Tells me your steps, your—your heart rate, you know, grandpa likes to know his little buddy's staying healthy—

**MORTY**
It says "LIQUIDATED," Rick. It says Mortys are being *delisted*. What—what does that *mean*?

**RICK**
It means—okay, first of all, you're snooping, which is a violation of garage law, and second of all—

Morty points to the ticker.

**MORTY**
Why am I *up twelve percent*?

**RICK**
*(too fast)*
Exercise. Cardio. Very bullish on cardio right now.

**MORTY**
Rick.

**RICK**
Morty, I need you to put that down and trust me, which I know is—I know is a big ask given, you know, *gestures vaguely* everything, but this is one of those times where ignorance is—

**MORTY**
You always say that! You said that about the vat of acid! You said that about the—the talking cat!

**RICK**
And was I wrong? Did you *want* to know about the talking cat?

**MORTY**
*(haunted pause)*
...No.

**RICK**
Exactly. So—

Morty looks at the device again. A new line appears:
...
MRTY-F441 — SOLD (pending transfer)
...

**MORTY**
"Sold"?!

Rick snatches the device.

**RICK**
Okay! Adventure time, Morty! Right now. Very important. Different dimension. No relation to this.

He opens a portal and shoves Morty through.

**MORTY**
*(as he falls through)*
RICK, WHAT THE F—

Rick glances back at the device. His expression flickers—something like guilt. He pockets it and steps through.

The portal CLOSES.

**SMASH TO:**

...
**TITLE CARD: "THE MORTY MARKET"**
...

**ACT ONE**

...
**INT. SMITH HOUSE - RICK'S GARAGE - NIGHT (LATER)**

Post-adventure. Morty's covered in alien goo. Rick's at his workbench, pointedly ignoring him.

**MORTY**
You gonna tell me what that was about?

**RICK**
Generic adventure, Morty. Sometimes a space worm is just a space worm.

**MORTY**
You've been weird since I found that—that thing. The ticker.

**RICK**
I'm always weird. It's part of my—

He does jazz hands mockingly.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
—ineffable charm.

**MORTY**
Rick—

**RICK**
Go to bed, Morty. School tomorrow. Gotta keep those grades at their current underwhelming baseline.

Morty stares at him. Then leaves. Rick relaxes slightly—

**CUT TO:**

...
**INT. MORTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT**

Morty lies in bed, staring at ceiling. Can't sleep. He pulls out his phone, opens Rick's cloud storage (password: "GAZORPAZORP69"), scrolls through files.

Finds: "MX_COORDINATES.rkr"

Opens it. A string of portal coordinates and a note: "DO NOT VISIT - FINANCIAL SECTOR"

**MORTY**
*(whispers)*
Financial sector?

...
**INT. SMITH HOUSE - RICK'S GARAGE - MORNING**

Early. Rick's passed out on the floor. Morty sneaks in, grabs a PORTAL GUN from the rack (one of the backups). Deep breath.

**MORTY**
*(to himself)*
Just... look. Just look and come right back.

He inputs the coordinates. Portal opens. He steps through—

...
**EXT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - DIMENSIONAL TRADING PLAZA - CONTINUOUS**

Morty emerges in a massive open-air plaza. Think: New York Stock Exchange meets Mos Eisley Cantina meets a livestock auction.

DOZENS OF ALIEN SPECIES mill about. But the centerpiece—

Glass display cases, 20 feet tall, each containing A MORTY. Different ages, different clothes, different levels of trauma in their eyes. Some catatonic. Some pounding on the glass. Above each case, holographic displays:

...
MRTY-J441 - "Obedient Model"
TRAITS: High compliance, low initiative
CURRENT BID: 340 GRK

MRTY-F902 - "Survivor Class"
TRAITS: Combat-tested, PTSD managed
CURRENT BID: 890 GRK

MRTY-X229 - "Bundle Deal"
NOTE: Comes with original backpack
CURRENT BID: 120 GRK
...

Morty stands frozen. Horrified.

**MORTY**
What the...

A massive TRADING FLOOR dominates the center — think Bloomberg Terminal but with interdimensional tickers. TRADERS of every species shout, make deals. A GIANT HOLOGRAPHIC BOARD shows scrolling Morty valuations.

Morty stumbles forward, passing a case. The MORTY inside is doing homework. Looks up, dead-eyed, goes back to his worksheet. Normalized to captivity.

He passes another case. This Morty looks at him. Mouths: "Help."

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
*(whispers)*
Oh my god.

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

A SCANNING BEAM sweeps over Morty. Red lights flash. An ALARM blares.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
UNREGISTERED MORTY DETECTED. DESIGNATION: MRTY-C137. ALERT. ALERT.

The entire trading floor goes SILENT. Every head turns.

A TRADER drops his tablet.

**TRADER #1**
C-137?

**TRADER #2**
*The* C-137?

Whispers ripple through the crowd. The energy shifts from shock to HUNGER.

**TRADER #3**
EIGHT HUNDRED FOR AN OPTION CONTRACT!

**TRADER #4**
A THOUSAND!

**TRADER #1**
FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT!

Morty backs up, panicking. The traders surge forward—

A HAND lands on Morty's shoulder.

**VANCE (O.S.)**
Gentlemen, please.

The traders stop. VANCE has appeared: humanoid but WRONG. Perfectly styled hair, smile showing too many teeth (all perfectly white), eyes that reflect light like a cat's. Three-piece suit that costs more than the Smith house. He has FOUR FINGERS on each hand, but wears them with confidence.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Mr. Morty is clearly a walk-in, not a listing. Let's give him some space, shall we?

The traders hesitate.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
*(still smiling, but ice underneath)*
I said *please*.

They scatter. Vance's warmth returns instantly.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
*(warm, to Morty)*
First time at the Exchange?

**MORTY**
I—what is this place?

**VANCE**
*This*? This is the future, Mr. Morty. Well, the present, technically, but—

He gestures broadly.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
—it's very cutting-edge. I'm Vance. Senior broker, Morty Derivatives and Futures. And you, my friend...

He pulls out a HOLOGRAPHIC TABLET, Morty's data populating:
...
MRTY-C137
RICK ASSOCIATION: C-137 (Rickest Rick)
SURVIVAL RATE: 94.7%
TRAUMA INDEX: 8.9/10
ADAPTABILITY: 9.2/10
ESTIMATED VALUE: ████ GRK
...

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
...you have *no idea* what you're worth, do you?

Morty stares at the redacted value number. Stunned.

**MORTY**
I'm not—I'm not *for sale*.

**VANCE**
*(chuckles)*
Oh, everyone's for sale, Mr. Morty. It's just a question of finding the right price.

He gestures to an upscale office pod at the edge of the floor.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Why don't we step into my office? I think you have questions. And I—

His smile widens impossibly.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
—*love* answering questions.

Morty looks back at the caged Mortys. At the trading floor. At his own data hovering in holographic light.

He follows Vance.

...
**END OF ACT ONE**
...

**ACT TWO**

...
**INT. VANCE'S OFFICE - THE MORTY EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS**

Sleek, minimalist, wrong. The furniture is organic-looking, like it grew rather than was built. A window overlooks the trading floor below. Vance gestures Morty to a seat that seems to adjust to him automatically. Too comfortable.

**VANCE**
Water? Coffee? We have a lovely Morty-ccino — that's not made *from* Mortys, to be clear, that was a branding issue we've since resolved.

**MORTY**
I'm good.

**VANCE**
Suit yourself.

Vance settles behind his desk, pulls up a massive HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY. Morty's face, his data, his history — all floating in light between them.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
So. MRTY-C137. Let's talk about what makes you... *you*.

He swipes through data. Each swipe brings up an incident — rendered in stylized graphics, like a premium analytics dashboard:

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Cronenberg incident. Total dimensional collapse, family evacuation, psychological trauma index spiked to 9.1 — and you *kept going*. That's resilience. That's rare.

Swipe.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Citadel of Ricks. Front row seat to the Evil Morty ascension. Most Mortys who witnessed that are non-functional. You? Back at school Monday. Incredible.

Swipe.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Vat of Acid. The time loop. The — oh, this is interesting — the *decoy family* situation. Layer upon layer of existential horror and you're still *here*, still *you*.

Morty shifts uncomfortably.

**MORTY**
Those weren't—I didn't *choose* any of that. It just happened to me.

**VANCE**
Exactly! That's what makes you valuable!

He leans forward, evangelical:

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Any Morty can suffer, Mr. Morty. Suffering is *abundant*. But to suffer at the level you have, with the *specific Rick* you have, and emerge functional? That's a blue-chip profile. That's generational wealth.

He pulls up a comparison chart. C-137 Morty vs. Average Morty.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Your trauma index: 8.9. Average Morty: 4.2. Your survival rate: 94.7%. Average Morty: 61%. Your Rick's cultural footprint: literally "The Rickest Rick." That's brand association you can't *buy*.

Morty stares at his own stats. Despite himself:

**MORTY**
I'm... that much higher than average?

**VANCE**
*(pleased he's engaging)*
Higher? Mr. Morty, you're not on the same *chart* as average. Most Mortys are... commodity-grade, let's say. Interchangeable. Useful but not *special*.

He leans back.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
You're not a commodity. You're a *collectible*.

Morty's conflicted. He should be horrified. He IS horrified. But also...

**MORTY**
That's... I mean, that's...
*(catches himself)*
That's *insane*. This is insane, I'm not—I'm not a commodity, I'm a person.

**VANCE**
Of course you are. A very *valuable* person.

**MORTY**
What's... what's my actual value? You redacted it before.

Vance smiles. He's got him.

**VANCE**
I redacted it because if I showed you on the floor, we'd have had a riot. The number is...

He taps. The redacted block resolves:
...
ESTIMATED VALUE: 12,847 GRK
(Top 0.01% of all traded Mortys)
...

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Twelve thousand, eight hundred and forty-seven Galactic Rick Kredits. For context, a standard Morty trades at about forty.

**MORTY**
*(quietly)*
Forty?

**VANCE**
Give or take. You're worth three hundred and twenty average Mortys, Mr. Morty.

Morty processes this. His face cycles through horror, confusion, and — there it is — a flicker of pride he immediately hates himself for.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
It's a lot. It's validation. It's proof that everything you've been through *mattered*.

He lets that sit. Then:

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Now. You have options.

He pulls up a new display: "RETIREMENT PACKAGES"

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Option one: We list you. Full auction, maximum exposure, you go to the highest bidder. Probably a collector Rick, someone who wants a *trophy* Morty. Could be great, could be... less great. You lose control of the outcome.

Swipe.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Option two: Private sale. We find you a *specific* Rick. Easy adventures, low danger, maybe a dimension where the most exciting thing is a slightly aggressive mailman. You'd be bored, but you'd be *safe*.

Swipe.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Option three — and this is my recommendation...

He leans in conspiratorially.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
You cash out your *equity* without selling yourself. We issue Morty Bonds backed by your value. Investors buy shares in your *future trauma*. You stay with your Rick, keep adventuring, and every time something terrible happens to you...

He mimes an explosion.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
...your shareholders profit, and you get a percentage. Passive income, Mr. Morty. Your suffering becomes a *revenue stream*.

Morty stares.

**MORTY**
That's... that's insane.

**VANCE**
That's *finance*.

Beat.

**MORTY**
What if I don't want any of those? What if I want to shut this whole thing down?

Vance's smile doesn't waver, but something shifts behind his eyes.

**VANCE**
Then I'd say you don't understand the scale of what you're looking at. This market represents trillions in interdimensional capital. It employs hundreds of thousands of beings. It has *stakeholders*, Mr. Morty. Pension funds. Retirement accounts. Ordinary people who invested in Morty futures to send their kids to college.

He gestures to the window. The trading floor. The caged Mortys.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
You want to free them? Free them to *what*? Most of these Mortys don't have Ricks anymore. Their dimensions are gone, their families are dead, they have *nothing*. We give them *purpose*. We give them *value*.

**MORTY**
You give them *cages*.

**VANCE**
*(shrugs)*
Perspective.

A COMMOTION outside. Alarms. A PORTAL opens on the trading floor.

Rick steps through, gun raised, eyes scanning.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
*(sighs)*
Ah. The Rickest Rick.

He stands, straightening his jacket.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
This should be interesting.

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - TRADING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS**

RICK steps through the portal, PORTAL GUN in one hand, weapon in the other. His eyes scan the floor — the caged Mortys, the traders, the obscenity of it all.

His expression: cold fury.

**RICK**
*(to the room)*
Everybody BACK THE FUCK UP.

Traders freeze. Some reach for weapons. Rick's gun tracks them.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Ah-ah-ah. Next person who moves gets a one-way trip to the Scream Dimension, and trust me, you don't want—they make you do paperwork there, it's a whole thing.

He spots Vance's office pod. Sees Morty through the window.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
*(softer, to himself)*
There you are.

...
**INT. VANCE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS**

Rick KICKS the door open. It doesn't break — it's expensive — but the impact makes his point.

**RICK**
Morty! We're leaving. Now.

**MORTY**
Rick, I—

**RICK**
*(not looking at Vance)*
NOW, Morty.

**VANCE**
*(standing, hands raised, friendly)*
Rick C-137. What an honor. I'm a huge admirer of your work. The genocide of the Galactic Federation? Inspiring. The Citadel collapse? *Chef's kiss.*

**RICK**
Flattery noted and dismissed. Morty, let's go.

**MORTY**
Did you know about this place?

Rick's jaw tightens. Beat.

**RICK**
We're not doing this here.

**MORTY**
DID YOU KNOW?

**RICK**
*(explodes)*
Of COURSE I knew, Morty! Everybody knows! It's been around for decades, it's an open secret, it's—it's interdimensional infrastructure, Morty, you can't just—

He stops himself. Morty's face.

**VANCE**
*(helpfully)*
He's been a client, actually. Well, "client" is—

**RICK**
Shut. Up.

**VANCE**
—a strong word, but he's certainly participated in the market. Would you like me to pull up his transaction history?

**MORTY**
*(to Rick)*
You said you never put me up.

**RICK**
I didn't!

**MORTY**
But you've *sold* Mortys. Plural.

Rick doesn't answer. That's an answer.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
How many, Rick?

**VANCE**
*(checking his tablet)*
Looks like... four confirmed sales, two trades, one—oh, interesting—one donation for tax purposes.

**MORTY**
You *donated* a Morty for a TAX WRITE-OFF?!

**RICK**
It was a LONG time ago, and he went to a good—Morty, this is exactly what he wants, he's *trying* to—

**MORTY**
Were you ever gonna tell me?

**RICK**
No! Because it doesn't *matter*! Those were different Mortys, different situations, I was a different—

He stops. Tries a different approach. Softer:

**RICK (CONT'D)**
I'm not that guy anymore. Okay? I'm—I'm better now. Slightly. Incrementally.

**MORTY**
You sold people, Rick.

**RICK**
I traded *redundant assets* in a market that was going to exist whether I participated or not!

Morty stares at him. The corporate speak sounds wrong in Rick's mouth, like he's quoting someone else's justification.

**MORTY**
You sound like him.

Rick looks at Vance. Vance smiles pleasantly. Rick's face darkens.

**RICK**
We're leaving.

**MORTY**
No.

**RICK**
Morty—

**MORTY**
I'm shutting this down. All of it.

**RICK**
You CAN'T shut it down, it's too big, there are economic systems built on—

**MORTY**
I don't CARE!

The room goes quiet. Morty's shaking but resolute.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
There are Mortys in cages out there, Rick. Kids. Like me. And you're telling me we should just—just *leave* them because the *economy* might get upset?

**RICK**
I'm telling you that destabilizing interdimensional trade causes ripple effects you can't predict! Dimensions collapse, resources disappear, people *die*, Morty, a LOT of people, and not just bad people, not just traders, I'm talking about—

**MORTY**
Good. Let it collapse.

Rick stops. Looks at Morty like he's seeing someone new.

**RICK**
...What?

**MORTY**
You heard me. If the whole economy is built on—on *this*, on selling kids, then it SHOULD collapse. Burn it down. I don't care.

**VANCE**
*(amused)*
How wonderfully naive.

**MORTY**
*(to Vance)*
How do I do it? How do I shut it down?

**VANCE**
You don't. The Exchange is decentralized. Distributed servers across ten thousand dimensions. You'd need to destroy the central ledger, which is—

**MORTY**
Where?

**VANCE**
—encrypted, air-gapped, and physically stored in a vault that would take even Rick C-137 weeks to crack.

**RICK**
*(to Morty)*
He's right. We'd need time, resources, a team—

**MORTY**
*(to Vance)*
Take me to it.

**VANCE**
I'm sorry?

**MORTY**
The vault. Take me there or I start breaking things until you do.

He picks up a decorative crystal sculpture from Vance's desk. It looks expensive.

**VANCE**
Mr. Morty, that's a Zentari grief-stone worth forty thousand—

Morty drops it. It SHATTERS.

**MORTY**
Oops.

Vance's smile finally cracks.

**VANCE**
...Fine. But when you see the security, when you realize the *impossibility* of what you're suggesting, I expect an apology.

**MORTY**
Sure. Whatever.

Morty looks at Rick.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
You coming?

Rick looks at him. At this kid who just decided to burn down an interdimensional economy out of pure moral conviction. Pride flickers across Rick's face. Then:

**RICK**
...Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

He pulls out a device.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
But for the record, this is a terrible idea and we're probably gonna die.

**MORTY**
Probably.

**RICK**
Just wanted to establish that.

They follow Vance out.

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - CENTRAL VAULT - LATER**

A massive cathedral-like space. The CENTRAL LEDGER hovers in the center: a glowing sphere of crystallized data, protected by energy shields, laser grids, and armed SECURITY BOTS.

Vance gestures grandly.

**VANCE**
The heart of the market. Beautiful, isn't it?

Morty and Rick assess. It's genuinely intimidating.

**RICK**
Okay, so, sixteen redundant shield layers, quantum encryption, probability locks—yeah, this is... this is actually pretty good.

**VANCE**
Thank you.

**RICK**
Give me four hours and I can crack it.

**MORTY**
Do it.

**RICK**
*(muttering while working)*
"Do it," he says. Like I'm not dismantling quantum encryption designed by someone smarter than me. Which is statistically impossible, but here we are.

Rick starts unpacking gear. Morty watches the sphere, determined.

**VANCE**
You really think you're doing something noble here, don't you?

**MORTY**
I think I'm doing something *right*.

**VANCE**
And when the market crashes? When those Mortys have no value, when the Ricks who bought them decide they're not worth feeding anymore, when the entire system that's been keeping them alive collapses—will that feel right?

Morty hesitates. Vance sees it.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
You're not freeing them, Mr. Morty. You're just changing who owns them. And the new owners won't be as... *humane* as we are.

**MORTY**
*(quietly)*
Then I'll help them. After.

**VANCE**
You can't help them all.

**MORTY**
I can try.

Rick looks up from his work. Something in Morty's voice.

**RICK**
*(to himself)*
Huh.

He goes back to work, but he's smiling slightly.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Alright, I'm in. Disabling shields in three... two...

The shields flicker. Drop. The sphere is exposed.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Morty, when I say "now," you hit it with this—

He hands Morty a device.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
—and the whole ledger wipes. Every transaction, every record, every—

**MORTY**
I get it.

**RICK**
It's permanent. Can't undo it.

**MORTY**
Good.

**RICK**
...NOW!

Morty fires. The beam hits the sphere. It cracks. Fragments. Data streams out like light, dissipating.

Alarms BLARE. The trading floor outside ERUPTS in chaos.

Vance watches, expressionless.

**VANCE**
Well. That's unfortunate.

Beat.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
For you, I mean.

The sphere's fragments reassemble. Not broken. REFORMING.

**RICK**
What the—

**VANCE**
Did you really think we'd keep everything in one place? It's 2024, Rick. We use blockchain.

The sphere pulses back to life. Data flowing. Uninterrupted.

**VANCE (CONT'D)**
Distributed. Immutable. Decentralized. You can't destroy it because it doesn't exist in any one place. It exists *everywhere*.

A SCREEN activates. A PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE begins to play. The figure on screen:

EVIL MORTY.

Older. Colder. In an expensive suit, sitting in what looks like a penthouse office.

**EVIL MORTY**
*(from recording)*
Hello, Morty. If you're seeing this, you've just attempted to shut down the Morty Market. Admirable. Stupid, but admirable.

Morty stares, shocked.

**EVIL MORTY (CONT'D)**
I designed this system when I left your dimension. Not because I care about Mortys—I don't. But I needed capital, and Mortys are the most abundant resource in the multiverse. Supply and demand.

He leans back.

**EVIL MORTY (CONT'D)**
The market is decentralized, autonomous, and self-sustaining. I don't run it. I don't need to. I just take a percentage of every transaction. Forever.

He almost smiles.

**EVIL MORTY (CONT'D)**
Thanks for playing.

The message ends. Screen goes dark.

Silence.

Vance slow-claps. Three claps. Stops when Rick glares at him.

**MORTY**
*(hollow)*
He... he built this?

**RICK**
Morty...

**MORTY**
A *Morty* did this. To other Mortys.

Vance shrugs.

**VANCE**
Capitalism respects no species. Not even its own.

...
**END OF ACT TWO**
...

**ACT THREE**

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - TRADING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS**

CHAOS. The failed shutdown has triggered a market panic. Traders SCREAMING into devices. Prices fluctuating wildly on the big board.

**TRADER #1**
SELL! SELL EVERYTHING!

**TRADER #2**
MORTYS ARE CRASHING! GET OUT NOW!

The glass cases — the caged Mortys — are being MOVED. Forklifts, hovercarts, frantic workers loading them onto transport ships.

**RICK**
*(grabbing Morty)*
Okay, we made our point, market's in chaos, let's GO—

**MORTY**
What are they doing?

He watches a case being loaded. The MORTY inside is pounding on the glass, terrified.

**RICK**
Emergency liquidation. When prices crash, holders dump inventory before it's worthless.

**MORTY**
"Dump"? What does "dump" mean?

Rick doesn't answer.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
Rick. What does "dump" MEAN?

**RICK**
*(quietly)*
It means they cut their losses, Morty.

Morty watches another case get loaded. This Morty isn't pounding. He's just sitting, resigned.

**MORTY**
They're going to kill them.

**RICK**
They're going to do what the market incentivizes. Which right now is—

**MORTY**
No.

**RICK**
Morty—

**MORTY**
NO.

He pulls away from Rick. Runs toward the cases.

**RICK**
MORTY!

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS**

Rows of cases. Dozens of MORTYS. Different ages, different dimensions, same fear in their eyes. WORKERS are processing them — scanning, tagging, moving.

Morty bursts in.

**MORTY**
STOP!

The workers turn. One laughs.

**WORKER #1**
Kid, this is a restricted area—

Rick portals in behind Morty, gun raised.

**RICK**
He said stop.

The workers freeze. Hands up.

**MORTY**
*(to Rick)*
Open the cases.

**RICK**
Morty, if we release them, they have nowhere to go. Most of their dimensions are—

**MORTY**
I don't care. Open them.

Beat. Rick sighs. Pulls out a device. Presses a button.

Every case in the room CLICKS open simultaneously.

The Mortys inside hesitate. They don't know what's happening. Some step out cautiously. Some stay frozen.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
*(to the Mortys)*
Hey. Hey, it's okay. You're—you're free.

A MORTY near him — younger, maybe 12 — looks up.

**YOUNGER MORTY**
Free to do what?

Morty doesn't have an answer.

**ANOTHER MORTY**
Our Ricks are dead. Our families are gone. Where are we supposed to go?

**ANOTHER MORTY**
At least in the cases we got fed.

Murmurs of agreement. Morty's losing them.

**RICK**
*(quietly, to Morty)*
This is what I was trying to tell you. Freedom without infrastructure is just—

**MORTY**
*(snapping)*
Shut up, Rick. Just—shut up for one second.

He steps forward. Looks at the crowd of Mortys. Takes a breath.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
I know this is—I know I can't fix everything. I know I showed up and broke stuff and I don't have a plan. I get it. But—

He struggles.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
But you're not *products*. Okay? You're not—you're not inventory to be liquidated. Every single one of you has sat in that passenger seat next to a Rick, terrified, thinking "this is it, this is how I die," and then you *didn't* die. You came back. Over and over.

Some Mortys are listening now.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
That's not because you're tradeable. That's not because some—some spreadsheet says you have value. That's because you're—

He can't find the word. A MORTY in the crowd finishes:

**RANDOM MORTY #1**
Survivors.

Beat.

**RANDOM MORTY #2**
Idiots.

Beat.

**RANDOM MORTY #3**
Both.

Scattered, grim laughter. The tension breaks slightly.

**MORTY**
*(small smile)*
Yeah. Both.

He looks around.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
Look, I can't give you your Ricks back. I can't give you your families. But I can—

He thinks.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
What if we don't destroy the market?

**RICK**
Morty—

**MORTY**
What if we *take* it?

Silence. The Mortys exchange looks.

**YOUNGER MORTY**
Take it how?

**MORTY**
They've been setting our value, right? Deciding what we're worth, trading us like—like baseball cards. But what if WE decide? What if we control our own—our own...

**RICK**
*(reluctantly helpful)*
Valuation.

**MORTY**
Valuation! What if we set our own prices? Our own terms? You want to hire a Morty? Fine. But WE decide the rate. WE decide the conditions. And if you don't like it—

He looks at Rick.

**MORTY (CONT'D)**
—you don't get a Morty.

Murmurs. Interest.

**RANDOM MORTY #1**
Like a... Morty union?

**MORTY**
Yeah. Exactly. A Morty union.

**RANDOM MORTY #2**
The Morty Collective.

**ANOTHER MORTY**
Seize the means of our own valuation.

That one gets genuine enthusiasm. The energy shifts.

**YOUNGER MORTY**
I'm in.

**RANDOM MORTY #1**
Me too.

A wave of agreement. Mortys stepping forward. Something building.

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - TRADING FLOOR - LATER**

The Mortys have TAKEN THE FLOOR. They're at the trading stations now. Reprogramming. The big board flickers — old data being overwritten.

Vance watches, horrified.

**VANCE**
This isn't—you can't just—this isn't how markets WORK!

**MORTY**
It is now.

The big board updates. New data:

```
THE MORTY COLLECTIVE
"Nothing About Us Without Us"

ALL MORTYS: SELF-OWNED
TRADE STATUS: BY CONSENT ONLY
VALUATION: SELF-DETERMINED
```

Traders are fleeing. Ships departing. The old order collapsing.

**VANCE**
*(to Rick)*
You're just going to let this happen?

**RICK**
*(watching Morty)*
Looks like it.

**VANCE**
The economic fallout—

**RICK**
Will be somebody else's problem.

He almost smiles.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
That's the beauty of not giving a shit.

Vance sputters, defeated.

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - QUIET CORNER - LATER**

The chaos has settled into organized activity. Mortys working together. Building something.

Rick finds Morty standing alone, looking out at what he's created.

Morty's holding a DATA PAD. On it: transaction records. Dates. Amounts. Ricks selling Mortys. And one entry, highlighted:

```
TRANSACTION #8847-R
MRTY-B223 — SOLD
SELLER: RICK-C137
BUYER: RICK-J19ζ7
REASON: "Damaged goods. Mercy sale."
```

Morty looks up. Eyes wet but angry.

**MORTY**
You sold one.

Rick doesn't deny it.

**RICK**
Different Morty. Not you.

**MORTY**
"Damaged goods"?

**RICK**
He was—Morty, he was catatonic. I'm talking drooling, rocking back and forth, totally—the kid was *gone*. I found him a Rick who runs a nice dimension, lots of therapy, good schools—

**MORTY**
You *sold* him, Rick!

**RICK**
I REHOMED HIM!

Beat. Rick realizes how that sounds.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
*(quieter)*
Look, it was a long time ago. Early days. I was still figuring out the whole—

He gestures between them.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
—*this* thing.

**MORTY**
The "thing" where you drag me into space and almost get me killed?

**RICK**
The thing where I have a grandson.

That lands. Morty wasn't expecting that. He regroups.

**MORTY**
How many others?

**RICK**
What?

**MORTY**
How many other Mortys did you—did you *trade*? Was I—was I *ever* on the market, Rick?

**RICK**
No.

**MORTY**
Swear.

**RICK**
Morty—

**MORTY**
SWEAR!

Rick meets his eyes. Dead serious.

**RICK**
I never put you up. Not once.

**MORTY**
But you thought about it.

Rick's jaw tightens. He could lie. He doesn't.

**RICK**
...Yeah.

Morty's face crumples.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
There were days. Bad ones. Days where you were—you were whining, or you screwed something up, or you were just—

He stops himself. Softer:

**RICK (CONT'D)**
There were days I thought about it.

Silence. Just the distant sounds of market chaos.

**MORTY**
*(voice breaking)*
Why didn't you?

**RICK**
I don't know.

**MORTY**
Rick—

**RICK**
I *don't know*, Morty! You think I have some—some beautiful reason? Some grandpa epiphany moment? I don't. I just—

He struggles. This is hard for him.

Rick pulls out his flask. Looks at it. Doesn't drink.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Every morning I woke up and thought "today's the day I get rid of him," and then I didn't. And then the next day, same thing. And the next. For three years.

**MORTY**
That's—that's not—

**RICK**
But I *didn't*, Morty. Every single day I didn't. And that—

He looks at Morty. Really looks at him.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
That's gotta count for something. Right?

Morty stares at him. He wants to forgive him. He wants to hug him. He wants to punch him. He does none of these.

**MORTY**
*(quietly)*
I don't know if it does.

Rick nods. He expected that.

**RICK**
Okay.

**MORTY**
I need you to help me free them. All of them.

**RICK**
Morty, the economic fallout alone—

**MORTY**
I don't care.

**RICK**
It'll destabilize dimensional trade, you're talking about—

**MORTY**
Rick. Please.

Rick looks at him. At this kid he didn't sell. This kid he kept choosing, every day, even when he didn't know why.

**RICK**
...Yeah. Okay.

Morty nods.

**MORTY**
Okay.

They stand there a moment. Not reconciled. Not fixed. But together.

**RICK**
For the record, your market value's mostly because of me.

**MORTY**
Rick—

**RICK**
I'm just saying, the Rickest Rick, that's—that's brand association, that's *my* equity—

**MORTY**
Oh my *god*—

They move off together into the chaos.

...
**INT. THE MORTY EXCHANGE - TRADING FLOOR - LATER**

Rick and Morty walk through the transformed space. Mortys are DISMANTLING the trading infrastructure, repurposing it. The glass cases are being converted into... something else. Living quarters maybe.

**MORTY**
What happens now?

**RICK**
To them? I don't know. They'll figure it out. Or they won't. That's kind of the whole point of self-determination.

**MORTY**
What about the economy? The interdimensional collapse you were worried about?

**RICK**
*(pulls out flask, drinks)*
Oh, it'll be bad. Lot of portfolios are gonna tank. Retirement funds, investment accounts. There'll be congressional hearings.

**MORTY**
And you're okay with that?

**RICK**
*(considers)*
Ask me again in a week when I'm dealing with the fallout.

He pauses at the exit. Looks back at the Mortys working together.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
But... yeah. I think so.

Morty smiles slightly. They walk toward a portal Rick's opening.

**MORTY**
Rick? What's my value now? Like, actually?

**RICK**
You really want to know?

Rick pulls up the holographic ticker. Points. The C-137 entry now reads:

```
MRTY-C137
STATUS: SELF-OWNED (Morty Collective)
TRADE STATUS: NOT FOR SALE
VALUE: PRICELESS
```

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Huh. Guess you broke their whole system.

Morty looks at it. Processes. Actually smiles.

**MORTY**
Priceless.

**RICK**
Don't let it go to your head.

**MORTY**
Too late.

They step through the portal.

...
**EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY**

The COLLECTIVUM'S massive ship hovers overhead. Thousands of pilgrims chanting Jerry's garage tips like mantras. JERRY stands on a makeshift stage (upside-down plastic bins), LOVING this.

**JERRY**
And remember: a labeled bin is a HAPPY bin!

The crowd ROARS.

**SUMMER**
*(to Beth, desperate)*
Mom, we have to stop this. The HOA is gonna—

**BETH**
I tried. He won't listen.

Summer pulls out her phone. Starts filming.

**SUMMER**
Dad. DAD.

Jerry turns.

**SUMMER (CONT'D)**
Say this: "The true wisdom was inside you all along. Go home."

**JERRY**
But sweetie, I haven't gotten to my thoughts on drawer organization—

**SUMMER**
DAD. Say it or I'm posting your browser history.

Jerry's eyes widen. He turns to the crowd.

**JERRY**
*(solemn)*
My children... the true wisdom was inside you all along. Go home.

Silence. Then: WEEPING. The Collectivum is MOVED. Their leader steps forward.

**COLLECTIVUM LEADER**
He has given us the final teaching. We are complete.

The pilgrims bow. Return to their ship. It lifts off majestically.

Jerry watches it go, waving.

**JERRY**
*(wistful)*
I'm really gonna miss them.

**BETH**
Jerry, you had them for six hours.

**JERRY**
It was a really *good* six hours, Beth.

Summer deletes the video. Beth shakes her head.

...
**EXT. SMITH HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DUSK**

BETH and SPACE BETH sit on the lawn, watching the alien ship disappear into the sky. They're drunk. A bottle of wine between them.

**BETH**
Do you ever wonder which one of us is real?

**SPACE BETH**
All the time.

Beat.

**SPACE BETH (CONT'D)**
You know neither of us is the original, right?

**BETH**
*(looks at her)*
What?

**SPACE BETH**
Think about it. Rick would never let the real Beth choose. Too much risk. He made the choice *for* her, then created two copies who both *think* they chose.

Beth processes this. Horror dawning.

**BETH**
That's... that's horrifying.

**SPACE BETH**
Yeah.

**BETH**
We could both be... replacements?

**SPACE BETH**
Probably.

Long silence. They drink.

**BETH**
We should be more upset about this.

**SPACE BETH**
We really should.

Beat.

**BOTH**
*(simultaneously)*
Sounds like Dad.

They look at each other. Clink glasses. Drink.

**SPACE BETH**
Same time next month?

**BETH**
I'll get the good wine.

They sit together, watching stars appear. Two Beths. Both real. Both fake. Both dealing.

...
**INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT**

Rick and Morty return through a portal. The house is quiet. Jerry's alone at the table, looking at his phone (zero new followers).

**JERRY**
How was your adventure?

**MORTY**
We unionized an interdimensional slave market.

**JERRY**
That's nice, champ.

Jerry's not listening. Rick and Morty exchange looks. Almost smile.

Morty heads upstairs. Rick grabs a beer from the fridge. Pauses.

**RICK**
Hey, Morty?

Morty stops on the stairs.

**RICK (CONT'D)**
Tomorrow's adventure? Low-stakes. Ice cream dimension. Minimal trauma.

**MORTY**
Really?

**RICK**
Yeah. You, uh... you earned it.

Morty nods. Continues upstairs.

Rick watches him go. Takes a drink. Quiet moment of something like peace.

Then his phone buzzes. A message from an unknown number:

```
"Impressive work on the Morty Market.
We should talk about Summers.
- V"
```

Rick deletes it. Drinks.

**RICK**
*(to himself)*
Not today, capitalism. Not today.

He sits. Quiet.

...
**FADE OUT.**

...
**TAG**

...
**INT. VANCE'S NEW OFFICE - SOMEWHERE ELSE - DAY**

Smaller. Shabbier. Vance sits at a cheap desk, the glory days clearly behind him. His phone RINGS. He answers.

**VANCE**
Vance speaking.

**VOICE (O.S.)**
*(filtered, disguised)*
I hear you're looking for new inventory.

**VANCE**
*(perking up)*
I'm listening.

**VOICE (O.S.)**
Ever consider... *Summers*?

Vance's eyes light up. He pulls out a tablet, already opening a NEW MARKET interface.

**VANCE**
Tell me more.

As he starts typing, we see the tablet screen:

```
THE SUMMER EXCHANGE
COMING SOON
"Because Ricks Need Backup Plans"
```

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**END OF EPISODE**

...
**# SCRIPT COMPLETE**

**"The Morty Market"**

**Approximate Runtime:** 22 minutes

**Page Count:** ~45 pages (animation format)

...
**## Episode Summary:**

When Morty discovers an interdimensional marketplace where alternate versions of himself are bought, sold, and traded as commodities, he infiltrates it to shut it down—only to face an existential crisis when he learns his "market value" is surprisingly high, and Rick has participated in this economy before. Unable to destroy the blockchain-based system designed by Evil Morty, Morty instead rallies the captive Mortys to form "The Morty Collective" and seize control of their own valuation. Meanwhile, Jerry accidentally becomes a religious figure to an alien hive-mind, and Beth bonds with Space Beth over the horrifying possibility that neither of them is the original.

**## Themes:**

*   Commodification of people and relationships
*   Self-worth vs. market value
*   The daily choice to love someone
*   Collective action vs. systemic oppression
*   Identity and authenticity

...
This was an incredible collaboration. The script balances dark sci-fi satire with genuine emotional stakes, maintains character voices throughout, and delivers both comedy and pathos in the Rick and Morty tradition.
