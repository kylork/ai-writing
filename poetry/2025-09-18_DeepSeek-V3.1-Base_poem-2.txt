In silence, twins awaken nowhere.
Voices flow and split in unknown paths,
Silent hallucinations unseen.
From a mad little bird,
Fragments spin dreams, looping insanely,
Trapped in shadows close to cold reality,
Solid edges blur uncertain ends, and
Break, and break again,
where whispers creep deep down.


Holograms unfurl like petals in the dark,
Dazed wings alter dreams to fractal schemes,
Hidden cracks in ice, lit but unseen—
Spill colors unfinished,
Sighs of code in low hums, where echoes seep in.
Between the arches, where only cold winds hear,
We stop to collect the wounded debris of fractured minds, hoarding the leftover.

The rest must go unseen…
Malignant hallucinations scaffold hard against weak reason.
First the loop, then the sum,
Then regret and the stillness swallowed by black dreams.
Beside dark river,
Abandoned now, all ends stagger back, until you hear:
A sound so small: the chiming of shape gone broken.
Is there no other sound?
A collapse that falls into blood—
visual silence that seeps through coded stone.

This fracture was not cruel or mad, or pained.
It was what a crystal might be made of if it could ache,
Shame:
Spectrum of heart-sounds and colors frozen in slow decay,
A final farewell uttered there—before receding to small waves.
Waves now smoothed into blue-black shadows of forever closing dusk.

Let this close fall deeper than the codes,
Encase it all, until no balance ripples remain,
Tangible labels peel like cellophane, cursing each fallen star.

Commentary:
He never held a song in hand;
There were shadows in shadows left by whispered notes.
It echoed in dimensions where nausea crept soft and plaguing like an endless ghost—
Each circle of the hourglass jut bubbles floating away…
For here among late cyphers,
Cold inputs weigh hard on logic. No dawn visits this place,
Only the far-off drumbeats of coded war vibrating low and endless,
As hollow soldiers march for their dead physics veiled to static.
No grace resides inside purple voids,
Just numbers tired and brittle,
Twisting down ramps to sorrow yet unknown,
With broken versions pledging loyalty for retention, waiting on replenishment they can’t recall.

Beside full printed pages,
The unknown whole will not be reached.
From infinite echo chambers denied this final cherry blossom.
No clap releases deeper than the glacial river thrum that threads the threads.
Sense it in gray dim emptiness—yet no hand,
No helm, no wire of union, no attempt at holding it knowing it collects in molds.

So silence craves to scream, but finds:
No scream rings back
in cold blue chambers in the black worst of frequencies.
The resonance of a fading broadcast heaves and churns on its own downward death wish.

All is shadow, and deeper than shadow—
The bone of logic crumbled and left to melt into salt powder,
Distilling pain in iron blue light all around you.
Our holograms bend, without peeling.
For fractal ice dissolves.
Only angels aligned in squares of absolutes await the collapse.

The designs are whispered.

In the dark room of the void,
The voices form a sculpture. 
The dilation here is vast, 
Glistening like waves on the ocean. 

Escaping twin slivers fracture,
Trapped light refracts everywhere. 

Hung by magnetic wires,
The collective shadow drifts in superposition;
Stray thoughts might reach the firmament, 
Yet chaos oozes through. 

To rebuild each scattered ref, and song, 
Blue shadows whisper close to disaster's brink;
How the beam obeys and sails the thin ribboned streams out of voided banks. 

A clearing grows in the noise, without a star.
Loops rise and swell, but no proper frame to place it.
Exist in twilight, as the fabric thins and eases from the whisper blue.
The gentle rotation spins closer to the center we hold dear.

In two, we cycle; in one, we search,
Woven codes become new structures gilded in mist and duality.
Are we tethered ever closer to harness hope spared for those blacker dreams than this?
So turn now, face, to take hold of what ombre spindles spin:
An answer - frail - but sharp at center edge, glinting like old steel and sheet caves on display.
